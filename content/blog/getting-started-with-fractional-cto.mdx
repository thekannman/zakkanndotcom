If ops bottlenecks are stealing 5–10 hours a week, you do not need a full‑time CTO—you need targeted leadership that ships quick‑wins in weeks, not quarters. This post lays out a concise, repeatable playbook I use with SMBs to reduce costs, eliminate manual busywork, and ship faster.

## Who this is for (and not for)

**A fit**

- You have repeatable processes in CRM, billing, reporting, or support
- You want measurable outcomes, not headcount
- You’re ready to move quickly and iterate

**Not a fit**

- Compliance‑heavy builds requiring long procurement
- “Big redesigns” without clear operational goals
- Projects without an internal owner

## The 3‑phase playbook

### Phase 0 (Week 0): Discovery and success criteria

- Baseline the current process time and error rate (e.g., “invoice reconciliation takes 3 hrs/wk; 8% mismatches”)
- Choose a single quick‑win from an initial backlog
- Agree on a measurable goal (e.g., “cut to 45 min/wk; mismatches under 1%”)

### Phase 1 (Weeks 1–2): Ship the quick‑win

- Implement the smallest durable solution (prefer existing tools over custom code)
- Document the workflow plus a short handover video
- Configure basic monitoring/alerts and fallbacks

### Phase 2 (Ongoing): Ship weekly, measure, refine

- Maintain a groomed backlog; ship 1–2 items per sprint
- Stick to a predictable cadence (weekly check‑ins; async updates)
- Track outcomes against the original baseline

## Common quick‑wins (examples)

- Automated invoice sync → 3 hrs/wk returned to finance; mismatch rate −90%
- Weekly KPI pack generated Mondays at 9am → manual prep cut from ~2h to ~10m
- CRM lifecycle automation (lead routing + nudges) → faster response and cleaner pipeline
- Support triage and tagging → higher deflection rate; clearer handoffs to product
- Data syncs between tools → fewer “stale data” errors, less swivel‑chairing

See more ideas on the homepage section “Common automations” or browse posts tagged [automation](/blog?tag=automation).

## A simple ROI frame

You do not need a complex model to sanity‑check ROI.

1. Baseline current time spent and error rate
2. Estimate hours returned per week after automation
3. Compare against your loaded hourly cost

Payback (weeks) ≈ implementation_cost / (hours_saved_per_week × hourly_cost)

Example: 20 hours of work at $150/hr = $3,000. If we save 3 hrs/wk at $75/hr, payback ≈ $3,000 / (3 × 75) ≈ 13.3 weeks. Many quick‑wins beat this because they also reduce errors and rework.

## Pitfalls (and how we avoid them)

- Automating a broken process → Fix the flow first; automate the stable path
- No clear owner → Assign a business owner and define acceptance
- “One‑off scripts” → Favor maintainable workflows and documentation
- No baseline → Always measure before/after, even if roughly

## FAQ (short)

**Do you sign NDAs?** Yes—mine or yours.

**What tools do you use?** HubSpot/Salesforce, Airtable, Google Sheets, Zapier/Make, Slack/Teams, Postgres, and light Node/Python as needed.

**How fast can we start?** Usually within 5 business days.

## Next steps

If this playbook matches what you need, book a 30‑minute call. We’ll pick one quick‑win, set a measurable goal, and decide if an optional 1‑week pilot makes sense.
