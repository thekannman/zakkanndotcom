title: Getting Started with a Fractional CTO

When you need technical leadership without the full-time overhead, a fractional CTO can be the highest ROI move.

Here’s how to make it work:

1. Define clear outcomes up front
2. Start with a focused pilot
3. Work async-first with weekly cadence

If you’re a founder or operator juggling growth and delivery, this approach can help you scale reliably without bloating headcount.

A typical engagement starts with a quick call to align on goals and constraints. Often an optional 1‑week pilot makes sense.
